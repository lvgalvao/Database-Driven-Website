# MySQL

MySQL is a widely used relational database management system. In this section, you will learn how to connect your Flask application to a cloud-based MySQL database and deploy a production-ready web application.

## Setting Up MySQL Database

To use MySQL in your Flask application, you need to:

1. Create a MySQL database in your cloud provider or set up a local MySQL server.
2. Configure the Flask application to connect to the MySQL database.
3. Define models and database tables using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) such as SQLAlchemy.
4. Perform database operations, such as inserting, updating, and querying data.

For detailed instructions and code examples, refer to the MySQL [official documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/).
